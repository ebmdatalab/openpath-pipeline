# Overview

This repository contains scripts, and per-lab code/configuration,
suitable for normalising and anonymising lab data, and combining it
into a single zipped CSV file, suitable for consumption by the
`openpath-dash` app.

Each lab's configuration is represented by a folder / python module
witin `data_sources/`, along with a bit of config in `lib.settings`

# Refreshing external data depencenices

    PYTHONPATH=.  python runner.py fetch

And then commit the resulting files (in `final_data/`)


# Data source anonymisation

To run the cornwall processor, for example:

    PYTHONPATH=. DATA_BASEDIR=/mnt/secure_private_data python runner.py process cornwall

To run against sample / test data (no-multiprocessing makes debugging easier):

    PYTHONPATH=. LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG python runner.py process cambridge --no-multiprocessing --reimport --single-file=data_sources/cambridge/example.csv

The runner is idempotent; current progress is recorded in a SQLite
database. Only new, unprocessed files are processed in a normal run. A
`--reimport` switch indicates everything should be wiped and started
from the beginnging

Files named `intermediate_files/combined_<lab_id>.csv` are kept after
each run, so new data can be appended to these files.

A complete set of intermediate data is required to run whole-dataset
operations after each new set of data is appended (such as low number
suppression)


# Making a data source



A data source is a package within `data_sources/`,
(e.g. `data_sources/north_devon/`)

It contains code and configuration that, given input data in a variety
of row-oriented formats containing one month of data per file,
converts it such that all raw test result values are aggregated to
"within range", "under range", "over range", or a number of error
codes indicating that the range could not be computed (for example,
because we currently don't consider children for reference ranges; or
because a value was non-numeric).


A data source must a file `anonymiser_config.py`.  This file must contain:

* `LAB_CODE`: a string with a unique token for this source
* `REFERENCE_RANGES`: path to a CSV of reference ranges (this may be empty; see below)
* `INPUT_FILES`: an iterable returning input filenames
* `row_iterator(filename)`: a function that yields rows of dictionaries from a source pointed to by `filename`
* `drop_unwanted_data(row)`: a function that raises `StopProcessing` if the row passed in should be skipped (for example, invalid or dummy data)
* `normalise_data(row)`: a function that normalises an input row to an output row with the fields `month`, `test_code`, `test_result`, `practice_id`, `age`, `sex`, `direction`.
* `__init__.py` to make this a python module

Currently we only process data for adults (18 years and older), so at
the point age is calculated, rows should be dropped for under-18s (by
raising `StopIteration`).

For labs that integrate reference range values into the result data
file, `REFERENCE_RANGES` should be an empty string, and you will also
want to implement:

* `convert_to_result`: a function which takes a `row` dict
  corresponding to the output row generated by `normallise_data`, and
  sets a `result_category` key which is one of the preset "error
  codes" (`WITHIN_RANGE`, `ERR_INVALID_REF_RANGE`, etc). See the base
  implementation at
  `lib.intermediate_file_processing.standard_convert_to_result` for an
  example

A data source should also include a README, and any CSVs and other
related material to help developers understand the data.

## Reference Range CSVs

For labs which provide reference ranges in a file separate from the
data, we require CSV files which are generated in a normalised form
from source files stored in `<data_source>/metadata/`.  They must
contain the fields `test`, `min_adult_age`, `max_adult_age`, `low_F`,
`low_M`, `high_F`, `high_M`.

A test may appear several times for different age ranges. We use `120`
as the ceiling for adult ranges.

By convention, these CSVs are generated by a python file called
`generate_ranges.py`, within each source folder.  See
`data_sources/north_devon/generate_ranges.py` for an example.

The presence of a suitably-formatted file, referenced by the
`REFERENCE_RANGES` variable, means "error codes" can be calculated
automatically.
